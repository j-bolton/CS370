# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The goal for this project was to create an intelligent agent that could solve a maze using deep Q-learning. To get started, I was given two Python classes in addition to a partially completed Jupyter notebook file. The first Python class is used to implement the maze environment, while the second class was used to store completed episodes. The Jupyter notebook file contained the code used to build the maze and play the game, but the Q-training algorithm was left to me to complete using included pseudocode. After completing the training algorithm, the intelligent agent was able to solve the maze after about 11 minutes of training.
# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists leverage technology to solve today's problems, from automating simple household tasks to controlling nuclear reactors. Computer scientists work at the forefront of technological advancement, and can be hugely influential to society on a global scale.
# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I approach complex problems by breaking them down into their simplest steps, reducing the complexity and making the challenges manageable.  
# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities include staying abreast of current trends and ethical concerns, constantly working to reduce potential harmful biases in my work. My ultimate goal is to benefit society as a whole without harming the privacy or wellbeing of the individual at any stage.
